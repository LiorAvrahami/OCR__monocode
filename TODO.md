# TODO

## cross correlation letter detector:
- implement handle_font_book_keepeing
- Handle Rotations - Currently rotations creat misalighnments betwean the grid and the letters in the lower parts of the grid.
- make a smarter small charicters filters. currently I just erase small chars that are in the middle of no-where. (small chars are:  . , _ ` - )
- allow usage without frame (implement usage with -hf turned off in cross_correlation_letter_detector/main.py)
